1. List everyone logged in and save the list in a file called “users” in your own home directory 
w > ~/users

2. List all processes that are running and add this list to the end of the “users” file

ps -ef >> ~/users 
3. List everyone who is logged on sorted by their username

users | sort -n

4. Count number of session each logged in user, sorted by this number in descending order

who | cut -d " " -f1 | sort -n | uniq -c

who command prints number of logged in users
using cut command: print first column that is list of usernames
using sort command: sort the list alphabetically.
using uniq command: print 'Group BY' of all users
now you want to know the number of instances ,you can use use uniq -c

5. Show content of the first and last 3 lines of the file “/etc/fstab” 

head -1 /etc/fstab && tail -3 /etc/fstab

6. Retrieve line number 5 to 10 from the file “/etc/fstab” and write these lines into a new file “extract.txt” 
sed -n -e '5,10p'  /etc/fstab > extract.txt

7. List all files in current directory, recursively, to which the user has full permissions 
ls -lRa

8. Compare two files and show percentage of similarities between them
$ diff --unchanged-group-format='@@ %dn,%df%<' --old-group-format='' --new-group-format='' \--changed-group-format='' a.txt b.txt

9. Find all files in current directory, recursively, that are at least 90% similar
